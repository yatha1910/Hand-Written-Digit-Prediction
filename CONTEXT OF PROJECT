# Hand-Written Digit Prediction with Neural Networks
This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline for classifying hand-written digits using the MNIST dataset. Key steps include data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation with a neural network.

Project Overview
This project uses a neural network to predict hand-written digits, covering:

Data Preprocessing: Standardizing and reshaping images for model input.
Model Training: Using a multi-layer neural network with ReLU and softmax activations.
Evaluation: Reporting accuracy and classification metrics.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:
"git clone https://github.com/username/handwritten-digit-prediction.git
cd handwritten-digit-prediction"
2. Install required libraries:
"pip install numpy pandas tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib"

# Usage 
Run the following to train and evaluate the model:
"python digit_classifier.py"

# Results
Achieves ~98% accuracy on the test set. Misclassifications are analyzed to guide future model improvements.
